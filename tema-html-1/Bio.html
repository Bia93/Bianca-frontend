        The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with
        reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns
        yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found on the surface
        of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The
        animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over
        hair. Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails. Their
        hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes
        on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their muzzles are
        blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their
        heads.

        The range of capybara covers a huge area, extending over much of South
        America to the east of the Andes, from Colombia and Venezuela southwards
        to northern Argentina. Capybara is found in lowland areas with close
        proximity to water. Preferred habitats include rainforest lakes and
        rivers, marshes, brackish wetlands, swamps as well as seasonally flooded
        grasslands and savannas.

        One of the biggest threats to the overall population of this species is
        hunting. The animals are hunted for their meat and hide. They also
        attract hunters for grease, found in their thick and fatty skin, which
        has pharmaceutical value. Capybaras are considered to be a pest species
        and are killed by farmers, who believe these animals destroy cereal or
        fruit crops as well as compete with domestic livestock, which isn't
        true.
